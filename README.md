#### Overview

This project will give you a chance to use the skills we've learned in class to create a site that highlights the skills and projects you'll be working on in WDI. You'll get a chance to use JavaScript to tackle interactions such as an image slider, a responsive hamburger menu, and quotes that fade in and out on a timer.

Make sure to customize the design and content of the website to make it your own.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you throughout the process and helping as you go.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS, adhering to best practices.
- Use Flexbox to create a multi-column layout.
- Must be responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop
- Include at least one HTML, one CSS and one JavaScript files.
- Stick with the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- Be deployed and accessible online. 
- Must pull in projects via API call from google sheet (lecture

#### Necessary Deliverables
- An About, Projects, Contact form
- A Git repository, hosted on your personal GitHub, that includes a link to your hosted site
- Repo must contain frequent commits (min 15+) dating back to the beginning of the project.
- A `README.md` file with the following:
  - Link to wireframe images
  - Technologies used.
  - Your process/approach.
  - Unsolved problems.
  - Your biggest wins and challenges.
- Screenshots of the snippets of code you used to solve particularly interesting problems (think code highlights).
- An in-class demo of the site that shows off the interactions you worked on.
- A carousel whose images slide to the side on a timer, along with indicators that the user can click to navigate to a particular project.

	- Use the internet to find great carousels! [BootStrap Version](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/) [Materialize Version](https://materializecss.com/carousel.html)

- Nav bar functionality that allows the page to scroll smoothly to the correspending section when a nav item is clicked.

- Nav bar functionality that highlights a nav item when the user scrolls to the corresponding section of the page.

- A mobile nav that expands and collapses when a user clicks on the hamburger icon.

- Remember that you should customize the design of the site and make it your own. Here's a guideline for what the site could look like:


- A working site, built by you, hosted on Surge.

## Medium Article

Three days after completing your project, please hand in a 500 word Medium article talking about the process of creating your portfolio, and the technologies used for it. In addition, talk about wins, struggles, and a code snippet for an interesting piece of code (with explanation & comments). These will be sent to your Career Coach for further review before being posted. They will reach out to you individually post-completion.

## Portfolio Samples

Check out portfoliios that look awesome and emulate the parts that speak to you. Here are some that we like but you should google around and find stuff you're into.

### Finding Good Portfolio Sites To Emulate - 10 min

Search and compare at least 3 profile web sites.  Record your findings in the table below and include some aspect of the site that you would like to incorporate into your own site. 

Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [http://www.denisechandler.com/](http://www.denisechandler.com/)| initial animation\drawing on page load
|[jkeohan.com](jkeohan.com) | mouseover on a project triggers animations |
| [http://mattfarley.ca/](http://mattfarley.ca/) |  layout of the projects

#### Starter Code

No starter code has been provided for this project, as you will be building your site from scratch. As an option, you can use the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) as a template to get started.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Don't hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems.
- Read the documentation for whatever technologies you use. **Most of the time — but not always — there is a tutorial you can follow, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.**
- **Write pseudocode before you write any JavaScript code.** Planning out and thinking through interactions for a website is an important step that will save you time and effort when you start actually coding.
- Do not simply copy and paste code that you find online! It is OK (and highly encouraged) to use resources like Stack Overflow when thinking through interactions, but use these sites as a guide and then write the code on your own.

#### Hungry For More?

If you're looking for an extra challenge, try tackling some of the tasks below:

* Add validation to the contact form to make sure the user has filled out all required fields before submitting.
* Add a skills section featuring skills you have/will have learned in the class.
* Add functionality so that the carousel works with swiping on an iPad/iPhone.
* Functionality that allows a carousel image to enlarge in a lightbox when the user clicks on it. Clicking anywhere on the screen when the lightbox is open should close the lightbox.
